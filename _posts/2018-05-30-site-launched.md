finally got around to making my github.io site after being shamed again by [@mkenworthy](http://home.strw.leidenuniv.nl/~kenworthy/words_of_advice_for_young_researchers) for not having a real personal website. fortunately, there exists a wonderful [guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) that walks you through setting up a site that leverages the [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and markdown capabilities that are baked into github. seems pretty slick and easy to use.
